A 15 day road trip through one of the most remote, untouched and pristine valleys of India - that's what goes down your memory lane as a lifelong experience. This is my narration of the experience i had when riding thorough [Spiti Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiti_Valley) in Himachal Pradesh.

**Disclaimer:** The roads that you see in the picture above are not normal in Spiti, they are a luxury in fact and thats the fun part of riding through the valley on an Bullet :)

Back in December 2015 i was at this mall in Ahmedabad with my cousin and he was catching up with his cousin sister as he was in the city. She went to Spiti Valley some time back and she was describing the experience they had and how remote the place and challenging the climate was. It was quite some time since me and my friend were longing to go a long trip to an unknown, unexplored place. A place that is away from the regular hustle and bustle of the city. Listening to her describing Spiti Valley felt exactly the place that we were looking for. Then started ritual of opening a webpage related to Spiti Valley each and every day for next 4-5 months. Finally it was 8th of July 2016 when we packed our bags and took a 15 day sabbatical from work to visit Spiti.

Below is my tale of the best trip i have made to date, one which was immensely satisfying, peaceful and adventurous at the same time.


Below is the our 818 km road trip played out on a [Google Map](https://www.google.co.in/maps/dir/Shimla,+Himachal+Pradesh/Sarahan,+Himachal+Pradesh/Chitkul,+Himachal+Pradesh/Kalpa,+Reckong+Peo,+Himachal+Pradesh/Pooh,+Himachal+Pradesh/Tabo,+Himachal+Pradesh/Mud,+Himachal+Pradesh/Kaza,+Himachal+Pradesh/Losar,+Himachal+Pradesh/Manali,+Himachal+Pradesh/@31.7690832,77.3429505,9z/am=t/data=!4m62!4m61!1m5!1m1!1s0x390578e3e35d6e67:0x1f7e7ff6ff9f54b7!2m2!1d77.1734033!2d31.1048145!1m5!1m1!1s0x3905db99979dffe9:0x6a2eb47ceff4ca38!2m2!1d77.7938376!2d31.5167835!1m5!1m1!1s0x39063a348d7e8a7d:0x94117ad4b7290d88!2m2!1d78.4366266!2d31.3507872!1m5!1m1!1s0x39066a28dd9e3323:0xbe5b52c8965c69db!2m2!1d78.2753776!2d31.5376578!1m5!1m1!1s0x3906546d82a99999:0x78d4ba61f08bf108!2m2!1d78.5902143!2d31.7640211!1m5!1m1!1s0x3906ebffb11edee5:0x7bff063fe6575975!2m2!1d78.3856447!2d32.0932586!1m5!1m1!1s0x390684b03e2fba4b:0x6f990e23738e4847!2m2!1d78.0322026!2d31.9594046!1m5!1m1!1s0x3906a374a0af9f8b:0x6ec85005a1175d47!2m2!1d78.0709903!2d32.2275991!1m5!1m1!1s0x390400dc0742c531:0x5d7818e83f51be14!2m2!1d77.7552218!2d32.4383305!1m5!1m1!1s0x39048708163fd03f:0x8129a80ebe5076cd!2m2!1d77.1887145!2d32.2396325!3e0)

![Spiti Valley road trip map]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/spiti-map.jpeg){: .article-content-img }

We started on bike from Shimla (after reaching there from Ahmedabad on train and then driving from Delhi the same morning we reached directly to Shimla) and ended the journey at Manali (drove back to Delhi in a car from Manali). We had a car all along the route with us so there was the luxury of dumping all our luggage into the car and ride lightly along the entire route. After searching through a couple of options for people providing bikes on rent we settled with Himalayan Riders

We went on this road trip kind of unprepared. Unprepared in the sense of the kind of gear you are required to carry when you are riding for long distances through rough deserted terrains. So i would be writing those things down here which we missed and which you can remember to not miss when you go on such trips. First of them is to have good bike riding gear wear with you. A good rider's jacket which can bear those strong hot and cold winds, knee caps, ankle caps ofcourse helmets. We did not have any of those except regular jackets & helmets (they should provide you helmets if you rent bikes, just be sure that it fits your head;). Ofcourse you can complete the trip without all that but its always better to have that gear on, you never know when you'll need it.

<h4>Day #1 - Shimla -> Sarahan (163 kms)</h4>

Actually it's already day 3. We spent the first travelling from Delhi to Shimla. We actually didn't manage to reach shimla on day 1 as it was too late and we were about 50 kms from Shimla. So we decided to halt at Kasauli and if you ever plan to stay at Kasauli on a weekend, DO NOT GO THERE EXPECTING TO FIND A ROOM IN A HOTEL. There wasn't a single room in Kasauli for the 3 of us. Post 3 hours of searching we finally found a hotel 15 kms downhill from Kasauli. Next day was spent in Shimla. Regardless of all that we started for Sarahan which is about 80 kms north east of Shimla. We started at about 11 AM and reached at around 6 in evening.

Accomodation - There are 2 options that i would recommend in Sarahan. A) Bhimakali Temple guest house (we stayed here) and the other is B)Himachal Pradesh Tourism guest house. Both of them are awesome other than the fact that B is more luxurious and more expensive compared to A. If you are on a budget and spending money on luxurious rooms and amenities is not what you wish (that line totally describes us) than A is the way to go. A doesn't have a restaurant and a bar (it's in a temple remember ?) but you can always go to B for the same. Approx cost per person per night - 250

Things to do - As we just stopped here for the night, we just visited the Actual temple which is made up of wood and might interest you in particular if you are a architect, designer or a civil engineer. Had a quick morning snack in the market (the tea tasted awful, but we didn't expect much once we left shimla) and we were off to Sangla Valley.

<h4>Day 2 Sarahan -> Sangla (Sangla Valley, 100kms)</h4>

The road from Sarahan to Sangla was long and a very tiring one as it was all dug up due to some construction work going on in that stretch. There are lot of hydropower projects in this stretch on Sutlej river and hence you may find stretches of bad roads. Also we faced couple of land slides on the way and one particularly was very fresh which had killed many of the ITBP soldiers in that area recently. Its when you visit such stretches of roads and witness the rocks on mountain slides that can come down sliding any second, warnings of shooting stones and live landslides, you feel that fear and risk part of such adventurous roads. We witnessed live stading on a bridge over Sutlej, peices of rocks rolling down from the mountain and crashing into rushing river and the sight can be terrifying yet marvellous at the same time.

Sangla valley can be avoided entirely if you just wish to expore Spiti as visiting Sangla requires you to take a detour from you path. But going directly to the next stop (i.e Reckong Peo) from Sarahan is a very long drive to cover in a day and plus there are couple of villages worth exploring in Sangla if your schedule permits.

Sangla holds a special memory for me. I had never saw in real a snow capped mountain peak. We reached Sangla at around 5.30-6 in the evening and there was it, the marvellous sight of snow covered peak visible through small open section of clouds. Evening sun was shining brightly on the snow peak and i spent quite a few minutes enjoying that moment and looking at the first sight of snow on the trip !

Accomodation - Lots of Guest houses in Sangla. Pick one which chooses your Budget.
Avg cost for a decent room - 500

<h4>Day #3 Sangla -> Chitkul -> Sangla -> Kalpa (84 kms)</h4>

Chitkul located in Sangla Valley, is the last inhabited village near the Indo-China border. This fact makes it very popular among the travellers on this route and many take a detour to Sangla Valley specially to visit this remote village. We started in the morning from Sangla to Chitkul. It is barely 1 or 1.5 hour drive (22kms) and there are couple of small vilages which come enroute. It was here that we lost our communication with our partner who was in the car and it was just two of us, the Baspa river flowing alongside us, mountains and peace !

Rakcham is one village that deserves a special mention. It comes just few kilometers before Chitkul. We stopped for a break here in order to wait for car to join us as there was no network coverage for even BSNL or Airtel. There were some 15-20 wooden houses in Rakcham (that was the first time we saw such wooden houses and they looked beautiful). The Baspa river flows just nearby and the village is located literally on the banks. Sitting a small snacks cum provision store we could hear the river gushing through. River flowing on one side, clouds kissing snow covered mountains on the other side and a extremely tasty omlette with your friend in small village with 50 odd people and such a pleasant weather. You surely cannot ask for more than this. That omlette still stands as the best i have had in my entire life.

You could be surprised at this but there is a UCO bank branch operating in Rakcham and we met one of the local employees at the store. We were talking about how lovely the place was and it would be great to have a workplace so peacefull as this. Contrary to our belief he told us that its incredibly hard to have a workplace like this because although its peaceful and calm but this calmness starts getting boring after sometime as there is very less to do here in terms of recreation and entertainment. Very few people to meet, no family and this place becomes very boring. And not taking into account the insane cold that ungulfs this region post August/September.

Moving on towards Chitkul we reached the ITBP checkpost where you need to register your self before entering Chitkul and there's nothing to worry about here unless you don't plan to come back the same day or you are from China or you are a terrorist. On reaching Chitkul we found very less houses and more hotels or guest houses. The scenic view of snowcapped peaks from Chitkul is famous but in July there was no snow for us on display. Nevertheless the view is still a beautiful sight to behold.

We returned back to Sangla after spending about an hour in Chitkul and as we had still like 6 hours of driving time available with us we started driving for Kalpa in Reckong Peo.

Reckong Peo (also referred to as just Peo by locals) is headquarter of Kinnaur district and is at an elevation of 2,290 metres (7,513 ft). Its a comparatively a busy and hustling town with considerable population. We reached Reckong Peo in evening at around 5-6 pm. Apart from the regular apple orchards, deodar and pine trees there is one thing that makes this place worth a visit and also has relgious strings attached to it and that is the Kinnaur Kailash mountain range. This is the place from where you can view the magnificient mountain range and its two most towering peaks Kinnaur Kailash (6050m) and Jorkanden(6473m).

Not to be confused with the actual home of Lord Shiva i.e. Mount Kailash (located in tibet) as per our mythology, legend has it that this is the place where Lord Shiva choose to hide for some time when trying to escape from an demon before eventually killing him.

There is a small town located above Reckong Peo called Kalpa(2,960) which offers you beautiful scenic views of Kinner Kailash Range and hence it is recommended to stay at Kalpa rather than Reckong Peo which is what we did. It was already dark when we reached Kalpa. There are quite a few guest houses and hotels available in Kalpa as it a place popular with travellers.

Accomodation - Lots of Guest houses in Sangla. Pick one which chooses your Budget.
Avg cost for a decent room - 500-1000

<h4>Day #4 Kalpa -> Pooh (65.9 kms)</h4>
Morning in Kalpa can be best described by images below.

Between intermittent gaps we could occasionaly catch a glipse of towering snow clad peaks which were a joy to behold. Lot of People specially visit this place just to sit and peacefully observe these mountains. We visited few nearby areas before moving on towards Spiti Valley from Sangla Valley.

<p>Suicide point at Kalpa (money back if you survive!)</p>

Just to note Reckong Peo is the last big town wherein you could get everything (garages,atms,petrol pumps etc) before Kaza so its advisable to buy stuff you need or might need and are short of here itself before moving on. First time bikers - please buy a can to store petrol from here on.

This is where you begin to notice the sudden change in terrain, greenery get replaced desert like barren plains and pine trees start vanishing. This will be an experience in itself as the lush greens that you are used to for travelling since shimla suddenly make away for desert like landscape. Warning signs on roads informing you there's every possibility of you getting killed by a shooting stone become a frequent sight from here on. Also same goes for landslides, although travelling with gushing Sutlej just beside your road will make it all worthwhile :)

Pooh is at an alitude of 2,662 metres. When approaching it from a distance it appears as if there's this huge canvas which is painted with desert sand color and at the center of it are patches of lush green colors sprayed randomly. It has some 1000 odd residents and also has an ITBP army batallion base here. Be careful to avoid photography nearby army camps and ranges as it is strictly prohibited by law. Roads leading to Pooh are excellent are a joy to ride on after back aching ride from Reckong Peo. You can hear the river flowing through at night and on a whole its quite serene and peaceful. When we reached here it had almost started drizzling and hence it added even more vigour to the atmosphere. We made our first acquiantances of our journey here, two bikers who had left thier jobs and had travelled all the way from Madhya Pradesh to Spiti on a road trip.

Pooh wasn't initially on our map but we decided to camp here for the night as we had very little time to travel further. It was already dark when we reached Pooh. Plus the weather didn't look too encouraging at that time. If time permits you can always travel ahead to Nako and make a stay there if you wish to catch views of beautiful mountain ranges visible from it. Distance between Nako and Tabo is 47 kms and is roughly 1.5-2 hour drive.

<h4>Day #5 Pooh -> Tabo (65.9 kms,3,280 metres)</h4>

With cheerful boards with messages from BRO(Border roads organization) and ITBP we marched on towards the confluence of Sutlej and Spiti rivers. Crossing the Bailey Bridge over Sutlej marks your offically entry to Spiti Valley. The confluence of these two rivers is a sight to watch as at both the rivers have stark contrast in the colors at the confluence. Sutlej is muddy brown while Spiti is charcoal grey in color and when two crash into each other, it's a sight to watch !

![Onset of a desert]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/confluence-sutlej-spiti.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Confluence of Sutlej and Spiti rivers</p>

We reached Nako at around 2 in the afternoon after stopping at various random places along the way. Nako is predominantly famous because of the Nako Lake. Its a small lake with mountain ranges as a backdrop and water is usually green but still a decent photo op sight. Probably you can give Nako a miss for night stay and opt for Tabo or Pooh instead. Nako also a little market with few shops just before the lake.

![Malling Nala]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/malling-nala.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Malling Nala on the way to Tabo</p>

Moving on towards Tabo we crossed Sumdo village, there's a small village 'Gheu' that is famous for the mummy which is preserved in a temple. We didn't visit the temple as we wanted to reach Tabo at the earliest and going to Gheu would mean a 18km detour. Do visit if time permits. Also apart from Chitkul there is a village named Kaurik that is the closest to international border. It's so close that standing from the village you can easily watch the Chinese posts. But unfortunately that entire village which was once open for normal citizens is now completely taken over by army because of obvious reasons. Also don't waste time trying to get permits for visiting Kaurik because they don't normally issue one unless you have someone at a significant position in ITBP or local civil bodies.

We reached Tabo at around 5 in the evening. Note of caution - Always carry few powerbanks with you throughtout the valley because the power supply is not reliable and has a tendency to get snapped at regular intervals. On entering Tabo we came to know that entire village was cut off from grid and the hotel and home stays were struggling to get even the kerosene to fire up the generators.

There was a large entourage of Australian and European riders who where touring the valley on bikes and there were many of them in Tabo, hence it was initially a bit difficult to find a hotel or homestay. Eventually after finding one we off loaded the luggage and went out for walk in the town after freshening up.

Talking about Tabo it was once again a lovely place amidst tall mountains on both sides and is located just on the banks of Spiti river. There are quite a few cafes and small eateries serving various cuisines catering to large group of foreign travellers visiting tabo. We started off by visiting the Tabo Monastery. The monastery has been rebuilt after it was damaged in earthquake earlier. The older monastery complex is also just beside the newly constructed one and you can stroll around and have a sneak peak into Buddhism. We meet couple of monks at the monastery and the we had varied discussions from PM Modi to Buddhism to Spiti. They invited us to come attend the morning prayers in the monastery at 6 AM. As predicted no one woke up the next day except me but i was determined to have the experience and hence i zipped up my jacket to fight the early morning chill and headed straight to monastery.

Although you hardly understand the prayer and the rituals but it's the experience that counts and it gives you a bit more insight into thier culture. If dicovering new things and experiences excites you (not to forget the experince of early morning in the mountains) then go for such things. The night we stayed in Tabo, it was  almost a full moon. There's a helipad just behing the monastery we went to late in the night and sleeping bare on the tarmac and viewing the sight of the sky above with mountains and a gushing river by side was an experience to relish.

The next morning we were to leave for Pin valley and as luck would have it, my going to monastery early in the morning helped us. There was a landslide on the way to Kaza few kilometers ahead from Tabo and although the road was still navigable but once the government machinery arrives to clean up the road it would be closed for vehicular traffic. As soon as i reached our homestay from monastery the owners advised to asap. I jolted everyone awake from sleep and we all hurriedly packed our bags and left without freshening up or even brushing our teeth. Such events are common in Spiti and we were lucky to not have our road blocked completely due to a slide anywhere on our trip. It messes up your schedule and hence it's advisable to keep a day or two in hand when you are planning for the trip.

<h4>Day #5 Tabo -> Dhankar -> Mud (Pin Valley) (65.1 kms, 3800 metres)</h4>

Leaving from Tabo and moving on towards Dhankar the road rises with altitude crossing 4000 meters for the first time in our trip. You get the feeling of the sudden rise as it feels a bit drowsy and the breathing gets heavier due to thinner oxygen levels. Having regular breaks and occasional tea/coffee or whatever that charges you up will be good to keep you going. We met a couple of men at the top for whom this weather was pleasant as summer and they were enjoying the time. They happily welcomed us to join them and they shared quite a few things about the place and how extreme the winters are in Spiti. One of them joyously said "Sab aap logo nai reh paoge yahan sardiyon me." (You guys won't be able to probably survive here in winters).

Below is a picture taken with them.

![On the way to Pin Valley]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/on-way-to-pin.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>On the way to Pin Valley</p>

Entering Pin Valley changes the landscape around you and after a gap of several days greenery was back all around us. Its quite opposite to dry and arid nature of Spiti. You can see sowed fields and agriculture in full motion at various places enroute to Mud. Make sure to make a stop at one of the "Matar ke khet" and try out the freshly produced bright green peas. We did that and you can feel the quality difference from what we get in metros !

On this route also make sure to catch hold of Himalayan Blue Sheep also traditionally known as [Bharal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharal) on the mountain slopes. It seems crazy to know the fact that these sheeps can graze at mountain slopes at altitudes of 3000 to 6500 meters and even more astonishing when you see them with your naked eye. **Take note** - beacuse of their skin color and the heights that they graze at its almost impractical to spot them just by looking around on the way. You need to take a halt and keenly observe moutain slopes such as the one in picture below to catch a glipmse of them. A high optical zoom camera will definetly help here. Had the guy travelling with us not spotted them, we would have never caught hold of Bharal. It took us sweet 10-15 minutes to focus on the slopes and find the sheep.

![Bharal sight spot]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/on-way-to-pin2.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Bharal sight spot</p>

It was my turn to drive on the way to Mud and all others were in the car. It was drizzling a little in the evening and Mud was some 5-7 kilometers away. Normally i absolutely love when it drizzles and rains but here surrounded by steep mountain slopes covered with silky layers of sand, it ignites fear inside you. The chances of landslides grow two fold when its raining as the sand loses its grip over the slopes and you definetly do not want to be crushed below one and die. I stepped up my speed a little in aim to get to Mud lest it starts raining heavily. As i passed this huge mountain which was blocking the view of Mud village the sight i saw next was the best of my entire trip. It made me forget all my fears and i stopped my bike right in middle of wherever i was and just admired what i was seeing. Words are hard to describe the scene and although we had seen quite a few colors of nature up till now, the colors we were seeing now were another level. Here's the pic below.

![Kaleidoscope of colors]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/mud-village2.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Kaleidoscope of colors</p>

The quality of above image doesn't describe the beauty that we saw through our naked eyes. There was this mountain slope which had purple coloured sand amidst green coloured slopes along with snow capped peak on the right and heavy rains and fog visible on the mountains at distance on the left edge. While we were shivering due to rains increasing the chill, the sight on its own was mesmerising to behold. The homestay we choose (there are very few really so not a lot of options) was the also the one right in the middle of town and had the best seating with views of valley no one can beat.

![View from our Homestay @ Mud]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/mud-village.jpg){: .article-content-img }
<p>View from our Homestay @ Mud</p>

Mud is the place many trekkers use as their launching pad for the popukar Pin-Parvati trek. It just has one 100 meter road and 20-30 odd houses on the either side along with a small hostpital.

<h4>Day #5 Mud (Pin Valley) -> Kaza (49.7 kms, 3800 metres)</h4>

Our next destination was Kaza which is the subdivisional headquarters of Lahaul and Spiti, the district under which Spiti valley falls. It's the largest township and commercial center of the valley. You can find nearly everything here along with many options to stay and eat. Kaza also boasts of having the highest petrol pump retail outlet of IOC at 3740 meters. There are quite a few places around Kaza that you should visit such as Key Monastery and the villages of Key,Kibber,Hikkim and Langza. We had arrived in Kaza in afternoon and we decided to straight to Langza instead of looking for a place to stay as there was enough time before the darkness.

![Kaza]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/kaza.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>View of Kaza from top</p>

Nestled between the mountains in a bowl shaped area, Langza is again a very small village located at altitude of 4419.6 meters about 13 km from Kaza. Langza is famous for its ancient fossils of marine creatures. You will be greeted by kids selling such fossils on the road if you pass through the village. Langza population is just 100-150 and prime occupation of people here is farming and mud work. All houses in Langza are made from mud in a specific fashion. Mud utensils and handicrafts from Langza are sold throughout the country. The natives of Langza  are kind enough to throw open their homes to travellers for stay and serve them delicous daal,chawal and rotis.

![Langza]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/langza.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Langza</p>

 As you enter Langza, the huge statue of Buddha sitting above the village facing the vast mountain range greets you. All the houses in Langza are constructed below this statue. TIP - have a night stay here instead of in Kaza if you are indeed planning to have one.

![Buddha over-looking Langza]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/kaza.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Buddha over-looking Langza</p>

From Langza we headed to Koumik which was probably our highest point in the entire trip at 4857 meters. It was overcast (which is rare in Spiti as the region usually recieves very less rains) and very very windy at the time when we reached. This made the climate extremely cold and it was diffuclt to expose your face for long. Koumik holds the record of being the highest motorable inhabitated village in Asia. A plate of hot maggi noodles and tea served from a local who was fortunately present nearby the Komik Monastery was enough for bearing the cold winds.

![Koumik]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/koumik.JPG){: .article-content-img }
<p>Koumik</p>

From Koumik next up on the list was village named Hikkim. It falls on the road back to Kaza from Koumik and has records of being World's highest polling station. It is also credited to have the World's highest post office. The Pin code is 172114. Make sure to post a letter to yourself or your dear ones from here. Fits the bill for a perfect gift or souvenir !

We reached back to Kaza and retired for the day after searching for a cost effective hotel for 2 hours !
