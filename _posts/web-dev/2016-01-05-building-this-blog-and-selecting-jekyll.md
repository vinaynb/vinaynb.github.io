Finally i am here with this post detailing my process of setting up my blog and in process my first tutorial to the community in general. Ok so without getting into much talking let's get to the matter at hand.

**Disclaimer:** With 2+ years of experience under my belt i am hardly a veteran for the web so there may be errors (glaring ones too) or things that i miss out or i am not aware of while writing such articles. Constructive criticisms and suggestions to improve the article are always welcome !

## How can you start a blog ?

First and foremost the blogs are nothing but web pages that run within a browser. Which effectively means you need HTML code to build your blog. You can go about creating your custom HTML pages and add some CSS to them to make them look awesome or you can use tons of free themes out there and get started quickly. In general basically there are two ways to go about setting up a blog. Both these ways basically are concerned around the platform where your blog will live.

- **Using your own server and hosting space**: Write code. Buy a domain name of your liking along with hosting. Go live !


- **Using other blogging services and providers platforms**: Use Blogging platforms such as [Blogger](ttps://www.blogger.com), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) etc. or CMS'es such as [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com/), [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) etc.

This blog is powered by Github Pages and hence i will talking about it in detail. If you need help getting started with other platforms then Google's your friend. 

## What's Github pages ? Don't we use it just to manage and collaborate our source codes ?

There's lot more to Github than just creating source codes repos and collaborating with other contributers. Github pages is a feature which lets you host your sites/blogs on github's servers, source codes of which are handled as a github repository just like your any other project. Github allows any registered user on its platfrom for two kinds of websites : 

* User pages 
* Project pages
